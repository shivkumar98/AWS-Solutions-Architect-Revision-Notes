# ðŸ§  1.1 Cloud Computing and Virtualization
* Virtualization is the core component of clouse operations
* This allows a single physical server to divide into smaller seperate units
* This lets you use divide the hardware resources to run seperate units with their own allocation of memory, storage and network access - as well as run different operating systems
* The flexibility of virtualisations means its possible to provision and run for x amount of time and shut it down.
* Resources can be released immediately, this enables you obtain maximum usage from hardware and generated sandboxed environments

## ðŸŸ¥ Cloud Computing Architecture
* AWS is a cloud provider which have **Server Farms** - thousands of servers and disk drives
* Cloud computing offers on-demand, self-service to pooled resources where usage can be metered and billed according to how much resource is being consumed - this allows for very precise billing modelsðŸ’¡

## ðŸŸ¥ Cloud Computing Optimization
* The three main features of cloud computing is:
  1. Scalability
  2. Elasticity
  3. Cost Management

* **SCALABILITY: **
