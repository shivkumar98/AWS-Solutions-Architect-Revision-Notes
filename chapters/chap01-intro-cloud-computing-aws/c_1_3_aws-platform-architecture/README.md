# ðŸ§  1.3 AWS Platform Architecture
* AWS has its datacenter for its servers distributed accross the globe.
* For low latency, you should host your workloads geographically close to your users.
* This can help manage compliance and ensure data is is kept within legal jurisdictions.

<br>

* The datacenters are enclosed within an **AWS Region**
* There are 21 AWS regions listed in this book - but more have been added over time
* When launcching an AWS resource in a particular AWS region you must consider costs, latency and service availability

* AWS Regions are exposed to your AWS account
* Resources from a region are organised within VPCs
* A **VPC** is a network address space which you can create network subnets and associate them with availability zones.
* This architecture can provide effective resource isolation and duplication.
