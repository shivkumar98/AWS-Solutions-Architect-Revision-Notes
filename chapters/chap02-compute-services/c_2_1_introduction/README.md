   - This includes cabling, firewall and networking
* AWS also provides away to monitor and administrate resources, and orchestrate containers
* This chapter will look into tools/practices to deploy powerful and cost-effective compute solutions
* The EC2 **instance** is the center of this all - it is a virtual server.

<br>

* The EC2 ecosystem can allow you to:
   - Allocate hardware resources to your EC2 instance
   - Setup the operating system for your app to run upon
   - Builld secure and effective network environment for your instance
   - Add scripts which can be executed when your app starts
   - Select the best EC2 instance for cost-savings
   - Manage the EC2 isntance life cycle
   - Choose the best storage option
   - Secure EC2 resources using key pairs, security groups, network access list, and IAM roles
   - Scale number of instances to match demand using **Auto Scaling**
   - Access your instance as an administrator or end-user client
   - Using Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to launch workloads
