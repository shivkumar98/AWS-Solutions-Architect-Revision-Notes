* You usually should encrypt S3 data using AWS or Self Served encryption keys
* There are multiple classes available in S3 which offer different levels of replication which helps you balance durabality, availability, and cost.
* Life cycle management lets you automate the transition of your data between classes until it's no longer needed and can be deleted.
* You can control who and what gets access to your S3 buckets through legacy ACLs or S3 bucket policies and IAM policies.
* Presigned URLs are also a safe way to give temporary access to your data
* Size and costs for requests against S3 and Glacier-based data can be reduced by leveraging the Select feature
