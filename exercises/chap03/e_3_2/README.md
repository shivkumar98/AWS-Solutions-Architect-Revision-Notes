# üèãÔ∏è Exercise 3.2 Enable Versioning and Life Cycle Management for an S3 Bucket üèãÔ∏è

## ‚úèÔ∏è Description ‚úèÔ∏è
1. Select your bucket and edit its properties to enable versioning
2. Upload a file to that bucket, edit the copy on your local computer, and upload a new copy (keeping the filename the same). Make sure you give the new file any access permissions you might need.
3. With the contents of the bucket displayed in the dashboard, select Show Versions. You should now see two versions of your file.
4. Add a couple of directories with files to your bucket
5. On the bucket's Management tab, create a life cycle rule and specify a prefix/tag filter that matches the directory name of one of the directories you uploaded.
6. Configure a life cycle rule by adding transitions and configuring the transition timing (in days) and target for each one.
