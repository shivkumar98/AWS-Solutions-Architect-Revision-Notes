## ✏️ Summary Notes ✏️
* Load balancing is related to network traffic and has no relation to meeting demands.
* You CAN change the public IP address, Instance Type and Security group of an existing EC2 instances. You can NOT change the `AMI`
* AMI = Amazon Machine Image
* The valid subnet IP address ranges are:
  * `10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255`
  * `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`
  * `198.168.0.0 - 198.168.255.255`
* IAM roles determine whether resources can access each other.

* C. Create an image from the EBS volume attached to the instance, select your new AMI from your private collection, and use it for your launch configuration.
* D. Search the AWS Marketplace for the appropiate image and use it for your launch configurationn.
* E. Import the snapshot of an EBS root volume from a different AWS account, use it to create an image, select your new AMI from your private collection, and use it for your launch connfiguration.

<details>
<summary> 📝 My answer 📝 </summary>

* **A,B,E**❌❌❌❌
* **CORRECT ANSWER: B,C,E**
* You can not take an image from a detached EBS volume because an image represents the current state of the instance
* So A is wrong and C is right.
* D is not a relevant option
</details>
